# Portfolio-Site
A portfolio site made to demonstrate my HTML skills, as well as hosting various projects I've built.

This is the first build of a portfolio site made for Udacity.com.

## Instructions
This project contains no instructions beyond opening the index.html in your favorite browser. It is built to be responsive, so it will work on multiple machines and widths. In addition, I've used normalize.css to help standardize what this site will look like across browsers. This is the only code not written entirely by me, and its information is as follows.

normalize.css v7.0.0 | MIT License | github.com/necolas/normalize.css
