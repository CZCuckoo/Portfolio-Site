# Movie Trailer Website
This is a movie trailer Website built to learn and practice Python.

## Instructions
This project was built using Python 2.7.13, and requires at least this version to run. Three files work together to make this project work, and must be downloaded and placed in the same directory. Run entertainment_center.py to use this project. Should you want to add your own movies to this site, modify entertainment_center.py in order to create additional instances. Be sure to include all new movies in the array "movies".

## File Breakdown
This project consists of media.py, fresh_tomatoes.py, and entertainment_center.py. Media.py contains a class "Movie", which is used to create instances of whichever movies you want to include in your site. Fresh_tomatoes.py contains HTML code, and two functions to dynamically create movie titles, and render each clickable movie poster.  Entertainment_center.py creates instances of the class Movie, containing all of the relevant information, catalogues all instances in an array, and opens fresh_tomatoes.py.
